BM60HSrgb

You don't need to use this unless you need "kc_gesc" or other advabced keycode.
This repo is to provide ESC/~ (kc_gesc) in your keymap for BM60.

I use KBFirmware JSON to QMK Parser to create local files with a few edit https://noroadsleft.github.io/kbf_qmk_converter/

This deafult keymap should work as:

ESC key ---> ESC
Shift + ESC ---> ~ (tilde)
Caps lock + ESC ---> ` (grave key)
Left Alt + ESC ---> Toggle IME (Alt+`)
Reference
BM60 is a KReblublic PCB and it has their own firmware for regular use.
